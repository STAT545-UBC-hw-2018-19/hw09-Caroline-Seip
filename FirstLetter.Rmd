```{r}
bar_dat <- read.delim("firstletter.tsv")
```

For this assignment, I computed the number of words that started with each letter of the alphabet

The most common first letter of a word was `r with(bar_dat, lowfirst[which.max(Freq)])`, which `r with(bar_dat, Freq[which.max(Freq)])` English words started with.

The least common first letter of a word was `r with(bar_dat, lowfirst[which.min(Freq)])`, which `r with(bar_dat, Freq[which.min(Freq)])` English words started with.

Here is a barchart of the number of words starting with each letter:
